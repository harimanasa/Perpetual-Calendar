# Perpetual-Calendar

<b> Question: </b> <br/>
Today we are all locked down in shelter in home due to the current COVID19 scenario. We observe that we don't want to step out for not-so-important reasons. 
Now, imagine that this started happened in the month of January and you forgot to buy a new Calendar. Since you got some time to do DIY at your home and you want to invest your time to creatively build a calendar using 4 wooden cubes that you found on your desk. 

Write a java program to implement this calendar using your 4 cubes?

Rules: You must use the first two cubes to represent the month and the rest two to represent the days.
